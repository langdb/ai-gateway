### Threads API

**Threads** are logical groupings of related spans in the tracing system. A thread is defined as a collection of root spans (spans with a `thread_id` but no `parent_span_id`) that share the same `thread_id`.

#### Endpoints

- **GET /threads**: List threads for a project
  - Query params: `limit`, `offset` (optional)
  - Returns: List of threads (grouped root spans) ordered by start time (most recent first)
  - Response includes pagination metadata (offset, limit, total)

- **POST /threads**: List threads with body parameters (same as GET)
  - Body: `{ "page_options": { "limit": 50, "offset": 0 } }` (optional)
  - Returns: Same as GET endpoint

- **GET /threads/{id}**: Get a specific thread by ID
  - Path param: `id` (thread_id UUID)
  - Returns: Thread object with metadata
  - Response: `{ "thread": { ... MessageThread object ... } }`
  - Errors:
    - 404 if thread not found
    - 404 if thread doesn't belong to the current project

- **PUT /threads/{id}**: Update thread metadata
  - Path param: `id` (thread_id UUID)
  - Body: `{ "title": "New Title" }` (optional)
  - Returns: Updated thread object
  - Response: `{ "thread": { ... MessageThread object ... } }`

#### Notes
- Auth and project context required (via X-Project-Id header or default project)
- All endpoints require valid project context from middleware
- Threads are automatically derived from traces table, not a separate threads table
- Pagination is applied at the database level for accurate results

### Schema

Thread response type: `ai-gateway/gateway/src/handlers/threads.rs::ThreadSpan`

#### ThreadSpan Fields:
- `thread_id` (string) - The unique thread identifier
- `start_time_us` (integer) - Earliest start time across all root spans in microseconds (MIN aggregation)
- `finish_time_us` (integer) - Latest finish time across all root spans in microseconds (MAX aggregation)
- `run_ids` (array<string>) - Array of unique run IDs associated with the thread's root spans
- `input_models` (array<string>) - Array of unique model names extracted from all spans with the same thread_id
- `cost` (number) - Total cost summed from all spans with the same thread_id

#### Response Format:

  }
}
```

#### Example Thread:

  "cost": 0.0234
}
```

### How Threads Work

Threads are derived from the `traces` table using the following SQL logic:

```sql
WITH thread_models AS (
    SELECT
        thread_id,
        json_extract(attribute, '$.model_name') as model_name
    FROM traces
    WHERE project_id = ?
        AND thread_id IS NOT NULL
        AND json_extract(attribute, '$.model_name') IS NOT NULL
),
root_spans AS (
    SELECT
        thread_id,
        MIN(start_time_us) as start_time_us,
        MAX(finish_time_us) as finish_time_us,
        GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT run_id) as run_ids
    FROM traces
    WHERE project_id = ?
        AND thread_id IS NOT NULL
        AND parent_span_id IS NULL
    GROUP BY thread_id
)
SELECT
    rs.thread_id,
    rs.start_time_us,
    rs.finish_time_us,
    rs.run_ids,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT tm.model_name) as input_models
FROM root_spans rs
LEFT JOIN thread_models tm ON rs.thread_id = tm.thread_id
GROUP BY rs.thread_id, rs.start_time_us, rs.finish_time_us, rs.run_ids
ORDER BY rs.start_time_us DESC
```

This means:
- A thread consists of all root spans (no parent) that share the same `thread_id`
- Multiple root spans can belong to the same thread
- Start/finish times represent the full duration across all root spans
- Run IDs are collected from all root spans in the thread
- Model names are extracted from the `attribute` JSON field of all spans (not just root spans) with the same `thread_id`
- Costs are summed from the `attribute.cost` field of all spans (not just root spans) with the same `thread_id`
